# my_backyard

Social game made in Godot Engine + Node.js

It was just an experiment, nothing too fancy.
You can't create/join room without connecting to the Node.js server included in `/node_server` folder.
The server is by no means scalable, it is just around 100 lines of simple javascript, and I don't even know javascript!

[I wrote a post about it on my blog](https://rilpires.github.io/games/mybackyard.html)
